**Nvidia Profile Inspector** - https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases



**CURRENT/LATEST NVIDIA DRIVER (572.16 or later)** - https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/





**This guide is going to be a step by step for a windows 11 only. I do not have a win 10 or any other OS on hand for testing!**

**Logic/Reasoning for this method:** I just don't like the nvidia app nor do I use any of the features included. AKA I consider it bloatware...
Thus being said this new feature is a great step in the right direction for them and I do believe its implementation to EFT is great for people that are struggling to run the game in its current state...


**How-To:**

**BEFORE DOING ANYTHING TO YOUR PC MAKE A RESTORE POINT ALWAYS!!!!!** (I cannot emphasize that enough)
